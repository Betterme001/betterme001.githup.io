   4. 完成态

      【核心思维】：回首往事

      1. 现在完成（现在完成时三种形式和一个注意）

         1. 发生在过去的动作一直延续到当下【延续性动词】，延续的动作+延续的时间=动作一直延续了。。。

            1. since + 时间点/从句
            2. for + 时间段
            3. 到目前为止：until now, up to now, so far.

            - I have lived in Beijing for 10  years
            - I have waited here since this morning

         2. 表示做过了什么，不能加延续的时间

            - I have worked here
            - She has read all these books here 
            - We've all been in love

         3. (发生在过去并结束的)动作产生的结果延续到了当下【瞬间动词】come，go, die, marry,（产生的影响延续到现在，绵绵无绝期），这些瞬间动词，不能加延续的时间

            - She has married.
            - She has been married.
            - She has been married for 10 years
            - I have  been young

         【注意】：短暂动词不能接时间长度，需要转变成延续性动词 be+过去分词。

         【现在完成时和现在一般时的区别】：完成时过去的动作与现在有关系，有言外之意，对现在有影响。

         - I am married
         - I have married

         【现在完成时和过去一般时的区别】：一般过去时动作在过去发生的，与现在无任何关系。

         - I have worked here.
         - I worked here

      2. 过去完成

         1. 一个动作在过去某一点以前结束。
            - They  had got everything ready before I came
         2. 表示非真实的过去，意为”本来要。。。" ，这样的动词有哪些
            - I had intended to see you, but I was too busy.

         【过去完成时表示非真实和虚拟的区别】：过去完成时，是真有的这个想法，虚拟是没有做过

      3. 将来完成

         - Until the end of this month, we will have studied here for three years.

      【 by/till/untill/before 的区别】

      - by 在。。之前， 包括当前时间点，通常用于完成时

      - before在。。之前， 不包括当前时间点，通常用一般时
      - till/untill 在。。。之前，一直。。（直到。。才）前面通常是延续性动词；not unitll

   5. 完成进行

      【核心思维】：动作到目前为止尚未完成

      1. 现在完成进行
         1. 动作从过去某时开始“一直持续”到现在并可能继续持续下去(根据上下文)
            - I have been waiting this for years.
            - You have been saying that for two years, when are you gonna put it into practice
         2. 最近一段时间内正在持续的事情（"口语中常说"：“我一直想要...","我早就想做..."）
            - I've been giving a good deal of thought
            - I have been meaning to talk with you.
         3. 说话之前在进行的动作（ 刚刚还在进行，但到说话时停止了），“刚一直”
            - Look at you, you are sweating[ˈswetɪŋ]. , what have you been doing?
            - Your eyes are red, you've been crying.
         4. 断断续续，多次发生 （ 短暂动词放到完成进行时，表示多次发生，靠次数取胜 ）
            - I have been coming to Beijing for 5 years.
      2. 过去完成进行
         - I had been missing you before I saw you
      3. 将来完成进行
         - I will have been studying English for 100 days by tomorrow.
